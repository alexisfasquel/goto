# Getting Started

* Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
* Run `grunt` to build the project a first time, and watch for changes.

# Building process
In order to keep the repository clean, the build process will:

* Run the compilation of the SASS code.
* Convert the HTML templates to JS
* Import all JS dependencies (templates)
* Copy all necessary resources (icons...) and sources files (popup.html/manifest.json)

# Development
The source code have been commented for the tricky part, but it is mostly HTML/CSS.
