        <p class="iconed cloud-block">

      <h2>How to use it?</h2>
      <p>
        If you reading these lines, then you want to have a better understanding on how to use it. Don't worries, the three following step will show you how simple it is!
      </p>

      <h3>Create your shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        Add shortcuts by using the built-in interface. Click on the button of the <strong>GOTO</strong> extension, and it will automatically help you to add a shortcut for the current website your browsing:
      </p>
      <img src="design/resources/add-screen.png" alt="" class="screen big"/>
      <div class="line-blue"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Tips:</strong> Use your shortcuts to resolves conflit and acces specific web pages with complex URLs.
      </p>

      <h3>Use your shortcuts</h3>
      <p>Now let's assume that you already created a new shortcut <strong>'g'</strong> so that you can have a quick access to your gmail account:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>g</p>
        <img src="design/resources/to.svg" alt="" class="icon-to"/>
        <p>https://www.gmail.com</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You now just have to use this shortcut wihtin the URL bar, <strong>end it with a ’/’</strong>, and press enter.
      </p>
      <img src="design/resources/use-screen-1.png" alt="" class="screen"/>
      <div class="line-blue"></div>
      <p>
        And <strong>voila</strong>! You are being redirected to your beloved gmail account:
      </p>
      <img src="design/resources/use-screen-2.png" alt="" class="screen"/>
      <div class="line-blue"></div>

      <h3>Manage your shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        Conveniently, you also can manage your shortcuts. And remember, they are synced to your Google account, so you can bring them everywhere with you!
      </p>
      <img src="design/resources/manage-screen.png" alt="" class="screen big"/>
      <div class="line-blue"></div>
      <p>
        At the moment, you can only add and removed shortcuts. You should be able to edit them directly in the future!
      </p>
